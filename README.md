# React/TS EsLint/Prettier Storybook Starter

Get up and running quickly with this starter. It comes configured to out of the box with TypeScript, ESLint (_with Prettier integration_) using `Create-React-App`. Because this uses CRA, you can add support for `Sass`, `CSS Modules`, `Redux`, etc. _AND_ have built in support for `Jest` tests/snapshots.

Also included is Storybook (_and some addons_) for documenting your components.
Normalize.css is included in `index.css`.
